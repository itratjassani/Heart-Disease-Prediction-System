## Abstract/Introduction
Timely identification of the symptom(s) of Heart Diseases is crucial to human health. Avoiding the unhealthy and taking necessary care to stop the development of symptoms can become very challenging. It often gets too late to see a consultant and treating the disease becomes very expensive, and life-threatening at times.

In situation of such illness, reaching to consultant or physician and going through the process of initial checkup and thorough diagnosis takes time and become challenging. At times patient needs to visit the doctor several times until the disease is identified.
	`
Heart Disease Prediction System (HDPS) is a mobile application integrated with a prediction engine, which uses data models trained using different data mining algorithms to identify cardiac disease development. Classification algorithm (such as Decision Tree, Linear discriminant analysis, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine) and clustering algorithm (such as Naive Bayes) are used to train the prediction model based on established data sets from machine learning repository. HDPS users can provide their habit, routine or health conditions in a data form and the application can make a prediction based on the trained model.

The above solution was designed using established Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC). Overall solution was broken into milestones, and an incremental methodology was used to develop the solution in phase-by-phase approach.

We will be having an application running on our Android mobile phones that will be readily available to predict possible heart disease symptoms we may be carrying. People will be aware of their critical health condition and will be able to take necessary healthcare decision before it’s too late.

## Module  
There are two basic modules in this system as describe briefly in below  
*	Doctor Module: This user is premium type of user who has some other additional high level functionality of mobile application.
*	Common User module: This is a normal level of user who will have few number of functionality of mobile application.

 
### Doctor Module  
This module includes all the common user module functionality, storing and retrieving the details of their patient.  
*   Create, Update, Manage, Delete Patients’ Profile.
*	Create, Update, Manage, Delete Patients’ Prediction. 
*	View and Analyze Patients’ Prediction and Profile.

### Common User Module  
This is a normal level of user who will have few number of functionality in application.
*	Create an account.
*	Get Verification code via SMS.
*	Sign In.
*	Using correct credentials.
*	Get access to the application. 
*	View and Manage his/her Profile.
*	Maintain his/her heart beat rate record. 
*	View heart beat rate in form of graph.
*	Can attempt self-test based on its profile. 

### Features  
There are many features in our system. Some salient and new features are:  
*	Create an account with phone number verification through SMS on sign up.  
*	Prediction Engine Integration.
*	All the users’ data will be stores on cloud.
*	Maintain their heart beat rate record.
*	View heart beat rate in form of graph. 
*	Email and SMS notification to emergency contact in severe detection.
*	Tips
*	Secure App
